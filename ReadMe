CRUD application [Create, Read, Update, Delete]

-Ruby application

rails new friends - creates a new rails project thats name is friends.

rais s - starts up the rails server.

rails is a mvc architecture- Model View Controller
Models- are databases
Views- are our webpages
Controller- The brains behind everything.

Mainly work in the app, config, db.
Need to break out of server to run other commands in the terminal.

generators- it does all of the work for us. creates controllers and much more files [rails g]
rails g controller home index. - creates a home controller for web page in app/controllers

railse routes - will let you print all of your routes to the console. essentially rakes all the routes so that you can see them.

<% %> most embeded tags in ruby look like this. if you dont want it to render onto the page don't have a = in the tag and add an = if you do want it to render and add word render.

rails g scaffold -creates everything needed for building database

supported data types:
.binary
.boolean
.date
.datetime
.decimal
.float
.integer
.primary_key
.string
.text
.time
.timestamp

rails db:migrate - creates a schema that pushes the migration into the database.

_working on building tables in ruby and messing around with styling and links is good practice_

\_Problem with the sign up page, it throws an error and will not work, throwwing a 201 and 401 error. problem with servisworker.js [installed that, and still having problems (possibly new ones)]. work to fix next time before moving forward.
